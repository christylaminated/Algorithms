# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains a diverse collection of algorithm implementations organized into specific categories for easy navigation and use. Each folder represents a distinct area of focus, showcasing various algorithmic techniques and challenges.

## Directory Structure

- **BinaryAlgorithms**: Includes implementations related to binary operations such as Gray code generation (`bgrc.java`), easy inversion (`easyinversion.java`), fast inversion (`fastinversion.java`), and palindrome checking (`palindrome.java`).

- **DoubleTrouble**: Contains two Java files, `DoubleTrouble.java` and `DoubleTroubleGUI.java`, implementing a strategic game with graphical user interface elements, focusing on dynamic strategy and user interaction.

- **GaussJordanAndDynamicProg**: Features implementations of the Gauss-Jordan elimination method for solving linear equations (`GaussJordanElimination.java`) and dynamic programming approaches to various problems.

- **HashMatrix**: Includes Java programs for hashing functions (`hashFunction.java`) and matrix operations (`ReadMatrix.java`), demonstrating data structure manipulations and complex data processing.

- **NQueens**: Contains implementations for solving the N Queens problem (`nQueens.java`) and counting the number of possible solutions (`NQueensCounter.java`).

## Features

- **Comprehensive Implementations**: From basic data structures to complex algorithms like dynamic programming and matrix operations.
- **Interactive Games**: `DoubleTrouble` folder features a game that integrates basic game development concepts with algorithmic challenges.
- **Educational Focus**: Each implementation is designed to provide insight into the algorithmic design and problem-solving strategies in computer science.

## Usage

Each folder contains source files that are standalone Java programs. You can compile and run each program individually. For example, to run a file in any directory:

```bash
cd DirectoryName  # Change to the appropriate directory
javac FileName.java  # Compile the Java program
java FileName  # Run the compiled Java program
